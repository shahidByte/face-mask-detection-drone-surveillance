# face-mask-detection-drone-surveillance
An AI-powered face mask detection system integrated with a drone surveillance module to monitor mask compliance in public areas.The project uses OpenCV,Haar Cascade Classifier and Viola–Jones Algorithm for real-time face detection and classification of “with mask” and “without mask” faces. The trained model can be deployed on drone cameras .
