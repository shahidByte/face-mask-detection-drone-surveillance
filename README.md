# Face Mask Detection Using Drone Surveillance

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to detect face masks in real-time using OpenCV and Keras.
It can be integrated with drone systems for autonomous mask detection in public spaces.

## Folder Structure
- **train/** – training dataset (with_mask / without_mask)
- **test/** – validation dataset
- **models/** – trained model files (.h5)
- **scripts/** – Python scripts for model training and real-time detection

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Run the project
```bash
cd scripts
python face_mask_detection.py
```

## Features
- Real-time mask detection
- Haar Cascade + CNN-based face recognition
- Drone integration for surveillance
